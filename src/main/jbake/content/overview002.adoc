The most important goal of the Java EE 8 platform is to simplify
development by providing a common foundation for the various kinds of
components in the Java EE platform. Developers benefit from productivity
improvements with more annotations and less XML configuration, more
Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), and simplified packaging. The Java EE 8
platform includes the following new features:


The key goals of the Java EE 8 platform are to modernize the infrastructure for enterprise Java for the cloud and microservices environments, emphasize HTML5 and HTTP/2 support, enhance ease of development through new Contexts and Dependency Injection features, and further enhance security and reliability of the platform. The Java EE 8 platform includes the following new features:

* New technologies, including the following:
